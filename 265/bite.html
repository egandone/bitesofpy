<p><strong>TODO PyBites: cryptography dependency issue, we're working on it</strong></p>

<p>Now that you have completed <a href="https://codechalleng.es/bites/264">the Fernet encryption bite</a>, now it's time to write some tests for it!</p>

<p>You will be starting with my implementation of the encryption bite, but I've also thrown in a clamytized Anagram class to test the encrypt/decrypt methods of the ClamyFernet class.</p>

<p>Don't analyze it, it makes no sense and its whole purpose is just to get you to write some tests for the encryption/decryption implementation of the Fernet class.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
